Another planned task is to explore basic optimization steps to make the YOLOv8 model more suitable for FPGA execution. These may include:
Choosing an even lighter model variant if required
Applying simple quantization during deployment (if needed)
Adjusting input image size to reduce computation load
These optimizations are intended only to support efficient execution on the PYNQ-Z2 board and are part of the planned continuation of the project.
